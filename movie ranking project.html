<h1> My ranking of the movies I've watched on theater! </h1>

<h2> Kinda short but will do (=w=) </h2>

<hr />

<h3>  1 - The  Super Mario Bros movie </h3>

<h4> Yeah, I love it, great graphics, voice actors, character design, just perfect, and even the song "peaches" has become a popular meme! 100% my fav theater movie. </h4>

<h3>  2 - The  Puss And Boots Movie </h3>

<h4> Really good, the story, graphics, everything's pretty good, just prefer the previous movie. </h4>

<h3>  3 - The  Super Pets Movie </h3>

<h4> Good, has great graphics, but a little weird, still like it though. </h4>
